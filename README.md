## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an end-to-end **data exploration, cleaning, business analysis, and visualization** on Zepto's grocery product catalog.

The project is divided into two parts:
- **Part 1 — SQL Analysis:** Data cleaning and business insights using PostgreSQL
- **Part 2 — Power BI Dashboard:** Interactive dashboard built on the same dataset

The goal was to extract meaningful business insights from raw product data — including pricing, discounts, stock availability, and inventory — to support data-driven decision making.
